- 1 Identify your unique and meaningful connection to your topic
- 2 Tell stories to reach people's hearts and minds
- 3 Practice relentlessly and internalize your content so that you can deliver the presentation as comfortably as having a conversation with a close friend
- 4 Reveal information that's completely new to your audience, packaged differently, or offers a fresh and novel way to solve an old problem.
- 5 Deliver a shocking, impressive, or surprising moment that is  memorable,  grabing the listener's attention and is remembered long after the presentation is over.
- 6 Lighten up with authentic humor.
- 7 Eighteen minutes is the ideal length of time for a presentation. If you must go longer build in soft breaks every 10 minutes.
- 8 Deliver presentations that touch more than one of the 5 senses,  such as visual/video, .
- 9 Be authentic, open, and transparent.
