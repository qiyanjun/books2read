- a good summary at: [here](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Leadership+U%3A+Accelerating+Through+the+Crisis+Curve-p-9781119753322)

- "Leadership is all about others—inspiring them to believe, then enabling that belief to become reality. That’s the essence of Leadership U: it starts with ‘U’ but it’s not about ‘U.’"

- the author lays out a framework—his “Six Degrees of Leadership”—to show leaders how to create change. 
	+ 1. Anticipate – foreseeing what lies ahead, amid ambiguity and uncertainty 
	+ 2. Navigate – course-correcting in real time, 
	+ 3. Communication – constantly connecting with others; the leader is both the messenger and the message
	+ 4. Listen – breaking down the organizational hierarchy to gather insights at all levels — especially what the leader doesn’t want to hear
	+ 5. Learn – applying learning agility, to “know what to do when you don’t know what to do”
	+ 6. Lead – empowering others in a bottom-up culture that is more agile, innovative, and entrepreneurial than ever before.
