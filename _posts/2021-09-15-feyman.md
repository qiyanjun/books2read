## "Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!": Adventures of a Curious Character
by Richard P. Feynman

- [URL](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35167685-surely-you-re-joking-mr-feynman)

- "Richard Feynman, winner of the Nobel Prize in physics, thrived on outrageous adventures."
- "In short, here is Feynman's life in all its eccentricâ€”a combustible mixture of high intelligence, unlimited curiosity, and raging chutzpah."
- Here he recounts  his experience 
	+ trading ideas on atomic physics with Einstein and Bohr and 
	+ ideas on gambling with Nick the Greek; 
	+ cracking the uncrackable safes guarding the most deeply held nuclear secrets; 
	+ accompanying a ballet on his bongo drums; 
	+ painting a naked female toreador.
