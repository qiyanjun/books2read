## "Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!": Adventures of a Curious Character
by Richard P. Feynman

- "Richard Feynman, winner of the Nobel Prize in physics, thrived on outrageous adventures."
- "In short, here is Feynman's life in all its eccentric—a combustible mixture of high intelligence, unlimited curiosity, and raging chutzpah."
- Here he recounts  his experience 
	+ trading ideas on atomic physics with Einstein and Bohr and 
	+ ideas on gambling with Nick the Greek; 
	+ cracking the uncrackable safes guarding the most deeply held nuclear secrets; 
	+ accompanying a ballet on his bongo drums; 
	+ painting a naked female toreador.

- "Feynman’s last literary legacy, prepared with his friend and fellow drummer, Ralph Leighton."
	+ Feynman’s first wife, Arlene, who taught him of love’s irreducible mystery as she lay dying in a hospital bed while he worked nearby on the atomic bomb at Los Alamos.  
	+ "also given a fascinating narrative of the investigation of the space shuttle Challenger’s explosion in 1986, and we relive the moment when Feynman revealed the disaster’s cause by an elegant experiment: dropping a ring of rubber into a glass of cold water and pulling it out, misshapen."
