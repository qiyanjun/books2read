- focusing on the foundations of self-awareness, internal self-awareness, and external self-awareness


#### Key Takeways

- Self-awareness is defined as the ability to understand oneself and how others perceive us
  + There are two types of self-awareness:
  + Internal self-awareness: Understanding our own behavior, thoughts, and feelings
  + External self-awareness: Recognizing how others see us

- Seven Pillars of Insight:
   + Values: Guiding principles in life
   + Passions: What we love to do
   + Aspirations: Desired experiences and achievements
   + Fit:  environment needed for happiness and engagement
   + Patterns: Consistent ways of thinking, feeling, and behaving
   + Reactions: Thoughts, feelings, and behaviors revealing our capabilities
   + Impact: The effect we have on others

- Roadblocks to Self-Awareness

1. Three blindspots:
   - Knowledge blindness
   - Emotion blindness
   - Behavior blindness

2. The "Cult of Self": Societal obstacles hindering self-awareness

3. The "Mum Effect": Difficulty in obtaining candid, objective feedback


- Strategies for Improving Self-Awareness

1. Avoid excessive self-analysis, which can lead to negative outcomes

2. Adopt a flexible mindset when examining oneself

3. Focus on asking "what" instead of "why" questions during introspection

4. Seek feedback from others to overcome blindspots

5. Develop both internal and external self-awareness through practical approaches

6. Learn to receive and process feedback effectively
